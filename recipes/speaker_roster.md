## Speaker roster at a conference

Taken from [GoGaRuCo 2013 site](https://github.com/gogaruco/gogaruco.github.com/blob/2013/data/speakers.yml)

* Begins with a document header that does not specify a yaml version. e.g. `--- %YAML%1.1`
* Is a mapping `:` of mappings.
  * The items in the roster mapping are mappings.
  * The items in the feature and sorted mappings are sequences `-`.
* The key for each speaker mapping on the roster is aliased as that key name `&atwood`
* The speakers on the roster are referenced in subsequent mappings such as featured with an anchor `*gray`
* The folded block followed by indentation `>` in the bios key concatenates the indented lines into one for convenient formatting

      You may know Jeff Atwood from his <a href="http://codinghorror.com/">Coding Horror</a> blog or his
      work on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow.com</a>. Now he is learning Ruby and using
      it to build a new generation of forum software called <a href="http://discourse.org">Discourse</a>.

    bio: >
      Constructed in the future to speak to the machines and sent back in time to prepare the humans for
      what comes next, James Edward Gray II might literally be built to be a programmer. Sure, there are
      more advanced models, but James has fought in the developer trenches and the battles have changed
      him. He now spends most of his time trying to download what he has learned into the brains of others
      by writing books, speaking at conferences, and contributing to the Ruby Rogues podcast.
